    <h4>
        Ingredients
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>6 skinless , bone-in chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano*</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil*</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>cracked black pepper , to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (or a light spray of cooking oil spray)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>⅓ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons brown sugar , packed</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups grape or cherry tomatoes , divided</li>
      <li>8 0z (250 g) fresh mozzarella cheese (or Bocconcini), cut into 6x ½-inch slices**</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh basil leaves , chiffonade</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
     <li>Preheat oven to 210°C | 410°F.</li>
     <li>Season each chicken thigh with the oregano, basil, salt and pepper.</li>
     <li>Heat the oil (or cooking spray) in a large oven-proof pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken on both sides until golden brown, about 4 minutes each side. Transfer chicken to a plate; drain most of the excess oil, leaving about a teaspoon worth.</li>
     <li>Return the skillet back to the stove; fry garlic until fragrant (about 1 minute). Add the vinegar and brown sugar; stirring to combine while heating through. Bring to a simmer, while stirring occasionally, until glaze has thickened (about 5-6 minutes).</li>
     <li>Return the chicken to the pan, turning in the glaze to evenly coat. Add 1 cup of the tomatoes, whole, around the chicken and place the chicken into the oven. Bake until the chicken is completely cooked through (about 30 minutes). Top each chicken with a slice of mozzarella cheese; return back into the oven for a further 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted.</li>
     <li>Slice the remaining ½ cup tomatoes in half; place them on top of the cheese; pour over some of the balsamic sauce from the pan and garnish with basil. Serve immediately.</li>
