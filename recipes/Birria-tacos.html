       <li>Beef chuck roast</li>
       <li>Guajillo Peppers</li>
       <li>Carrots</li>
       <li>Onions</li>
       <li>7-8 cups hot water</li>
       <li>1 garlic bulb cut the narrow top off, no need to peel</li>
       <li>5 bay leaves dried</li>
       <li>3 tbsp chicken boullion</li>
       <li>1-2 tsp chili powder</li>
       <li>1 tsp mexican oregano</li>
       <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
       <li>1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <Ol>
    <li>In large pot add meat, onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaves and dried peppers.
         Cover with water.
         (This uses my large 7 qt pot and fills it to the top!)</li>
    <li>Add chicken bouillon, oregano, cumin and salt, stir to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>After 30 minutes, skim the top of the pot to remove impurities from the bone cooking out. (will look like little bits of foam on the top)</li>
    <li>Remove the peppers (should be softened), onion, garlic (squeeze the cloves out of the bulb) and carrots and place in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, add up to 1/4 cup of broth if needed to help get a smooth consistency. </li>
    <li>Strain the peppers if needed to remove bits of skin (if using a high powered blender this step is not necessary). </li>
    <li>Add the blended peppers into the broth and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Add in the chili powder as desired to get a nice deep red color to the broth. </li>
    <li>Cover and continue to simmer for about 3 hours or until meat is tender and easily shredding on itâ€™s own.
         (remove lid and give a stir every 40 minutes or so.
          Can also taste the broth once the meat is cooked through and adjust seasonings as needed).
        </li>
    <li>Skim the grease from the top of the broth (SAVE THIS!) pour the grease into a small skillet or saucepan, this is used for making the tacos if desired. </li>
    <li>Remove the meat from the broth and cut into large chunks for serving. Remove any bones. </li>
